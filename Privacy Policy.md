# Privacy Policy for Clock Photo Album iOS App

**Effective date:** April 1, 2025

Thank you for using the Clock Photo Album iOS application (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our App.

**We want to be clear and upfront: Our App does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data or personally identifiable information from its users.**

## Information Collection and Use

The Clock Photo Album app is designed with your privacy as a priority. We do **not** collect any information that can be used to identify you ("Personal Data").

* **Photos and Albums:** The App requires access to your photo library solely to allow you to select photos for display within the App on your device. Your photos are processed locally on your device only. We do not view, upload, collect, or store your photos or access your photo library metadata.
* **Usage Data:** The App does not collect any information on how you use the App (e.g., features used, session duration).
* **Device Information:** The App does not collect any information about your device (e.g., device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers).

Since we do not collect any data, we do not use it for any purpose, including advertising, analytics, or sharing with third parties.

## Log Data

The App itself does not generate or collect any Log Data. Standard, non-personally identifiable information might be collected by Apple as part of the App Store's standard operations and crash reporting (if enabled by the user at the OS level), which is governed by Apple's own privacy policy. We do not have access to this data in a way that identifies individual users.

## Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data, commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are typically sent to your browser from websites you visit.

This App does **not** use "cookies" or similar tracking technologies.

## Service Providers

We do **not** employ any third-party companies or individuals ("Service Providers") to facilitate our App, provide the App on our behalf, perform App-related services, or assist us in analyzing how our App is used, as no data collection or analysis takes place.

## Security

Since the App does not collect, store, or transmit your data, your information (such as the photos you select) resides solely on your local device under the security measures provided by Apple's iOS operating system.

## Links to Other Sites

Our App does **not** contain links to other sites that are not operated by us.

## Children's Privacy

Our App does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children"). In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from anyone, including children under 13. As our App collects **no data whatsoever**, it inherently does not collect any information from children.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page or potentially through an update description on the App Store.

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
